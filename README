Assignment:
    Write a Simple calculator with +, -, /, *. It will take the string
    as arguments from the commandline but as interface to the test we will make
    small helper functions (as you should) to keep the units as small as
    possible. Here is a small list that can help in the development of the app:

        1) Start buy implementing the Lexer.
            We will only except whitespace seperated literals and operators
        2) Write a small AST builder.
            Its should translat the tokens to a tree structure where each node
            is one calculation unit. The left and the right is subtrees and the
            node data is the operator. If the node is a leeaf its a value node
            and the value should be returnd as is.
        3) Write a evaluator. It traverses the tree and calculates the nodes.
            If this was a compiler we would instead write the code to calculate
            the expression instead of acutaly evaluate it.
        4) Write the main function that runs the programs directing the input
            through the process.

    Try to avoid complex data structures and use values when you can.
